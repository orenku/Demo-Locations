//TODOs and comments

1. Using ng-repeat for displaying the list of locations. It might be better to
use Ionic's collection-repeat for better performance

2. 'Category select' is currently part of the locations ion-content, so it
scrolls down with the page. Probably better to insert it into the sub-header of
the page, but this requires some modification to Ionic sass/css definitions
